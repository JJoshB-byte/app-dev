# My Favorite Movie

One of my all-time favorite movies is **Inception**. It's a mind-bending thriller directed by **Christopher Nolan** that explores the concept of dreams within dreams.

## Why I Love It:
- **Engaging Plot**: The layers of dreams keep you guessing until the very end.
- **Visuals**: The special effects are stunning, especially the rotating hallway scene.
- **Cast**: Featuring **Leonardo DiCaprio**, **Joseph Gordon-Levitt**, and **Elliot Page**.
